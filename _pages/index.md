## Biosketch

Christian Gagné is a professor at the [Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering Department](https://www.fsg.ulaval.ca/departements/departement-de-genie-electrique-et-de-genie-informatique) of [Université Laval](https://www.ulaval.ca/en) since 2008. He is director of the [Institute Intelligence and Data (IID)](https://iid.ulaval.ca/en/). He holds a [Canada-CIFAR Artificial Intelligence Chair](https://cifar.ca/ai/canada-cifar-ai-chairs/) and is an academic associate member to [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en). He is also a member of the [Computer Vision and Systems Laboratory](http://vision.gel.ulaval.ca/en/index.php) (CVSL), a component of the [Robotics, Vision and Machine Intelligence Research Centre](https://cervim.ulaval.ca/?page_id=115&lang=en) (CeRVIM), and the [Big Data Research Centre](https://crdm.ulaval.ca) (CRDM) of Université Laval. He is also participating to the [REPARTI](https://reparti.ulaval.ca/?page_id=115&lang=en) and [UNIQUE](https://www.unique.quebec/home) strategic clusters of the FRQNT, the [VITAM](https://vitam.ulaval.ca/en/) FRQS center and the [International Observatory on the Societal Impacts of AI](https://www.obvia.ca/en) (OBVIA).

He completed a PhD in Electrical Engineering (Université Laval) in 2005 and then had a postdoctoral stay jointly at [INRIA Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-saclay-centre) (France) and the [University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/unil/en/home.html) (Switzerland) in 2005-2006. He worked as research associate in the industry between 2006 and 2008.

His research interests lie in deep learning and stochastic optimization. In particular, he is interested in the robustness and generalization of deep neural networks, neuro-symbolic approaches to enhance their interpretability, and the development of multimodal foundation models. An important part of his work also involves the practical application of these techniques in fields such as computer vision, super-resolution microscopy, health, transportation and energy.
