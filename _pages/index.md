## Biosketch

Christian Gagné is a professor at the [Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering Department](https://www.gelgif.ulaval.ca) of [Université Laval](https://www.ulaval.ca/en) since 2008. He is director of the [Institute Intelligence and Data (IID)](https://iid.ulaval.ca/en/). He holds a [Canada-CIFAR Artificial Intelligence Chair](https://cifar.ca/ai/canada-cifar-ai-chairs/) and is an associate member to [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en). He is also a member of the [Computer Vision and Systems Laboratory](http://vision.gel.ulaval.ca/en/index.php) (CVSL), a component of the [Robotics, Vision and Machine Intelligence Research Centre](https://cervim.ulaval.ca/?page_id=115&lang=en) (CeRVIM), and the [Big Data Research Centre](https://crdm.ulaval.ca) (BDRC) of Université Laval. He is also participating to the [REPARTI](http://reparti.gel.ulaval.ca/en/index.php) and [UNIQUE](https://sites.google.com/view/unique-neuro-ai/abou) strategic clusters of the FRQNT, the [VITAM](http://vitam.ulaval.ca/) FRQS center and the [International Observatory on the Societal Impacts of AI](https://observatoire-ia.ulaval.ca/) (OBVIA).

He completed a PhD in Electrical Engineering (Université Laval) in 2005 and then had a postdoctoral stay jointly at [INRIA Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/saclay) (France) and the [University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/central/en/home.html) (Switzerland) in 2005-2006. He worked as research associate in the industry between 2006 and 2008.

His research interests are on the development of methods for machine learning and stochastic optimization. In particular, he is interested by deep neural networks, representation learning and transfer, meta-learning and multitask learning. He is also interested by optimization approaches based on probabilistic models and evolutionary algorithms for black-box optimization and automatic programming, among others. A significant share of his research work is on the practical use of these techniques in domains such as computer vision, microscopy, health, energy and transportation.
